CropSentinel AI is an integrated agricultural intelligence platform designed to empower farmers with real-time monitoring and instant disease diagnosis. This project was developed as a prototype for a 6-hour hackathon, focusing on the agricultural landscape of Telangana, India.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🍃 AI Leaf Doctor:** Instant crop disease diagnosis using a custom-trained TensorFlow.js model (Teachable Machine).
* **🎥 24/7 AI Monitor:** Real-time field surveillance using the COCO-SSD model to detect animal intrusions (cows, dogs, etc.).
* **🚨 Automated Emergency Alarm:** Acoustic deterrent system that triggers a loud alarm upon detecting an intruder.
* **🌦️ Smart Weather Forecast:** Live meteorological data integration via OpenWeatherMap API for precision farming advice.
* **💡 AI Decision Support:** Dynamic agricultural tips based on real-time weather conditions.
* **🌙 Farmer-Centric UI:** High-contrast Dark Mode design for low-light field usage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js, Google Teachable Machine, COCO-SSD
* **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap API
* **Tools:** VS Code, Live Server

## 📋 Future Scope
* Integration of local languages (Telugu) for broader accessibility.
* SMS/WhatsApp alerts for weather and intrusion warnings.
* Soil moisture sensor integration for automated irrigation.
